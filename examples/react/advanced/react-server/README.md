## Overview

This example demonstrates the use of a simple Express proxy server with an ORE ID app.
- Setting up a simple server using Express
- Hooking up a proxy for requests

If your app runs completely in the browser (like a create-react-app does), using a proxy server is required to protect your api keys - otherwise they would be exposed in the browser console.
