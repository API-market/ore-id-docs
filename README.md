# ORE ID - OAuth for Blockchain



ORE ID allows anyone to access your dApp with one-click sign up and blockchain account creation - using a login flow that they are already familiar with. ORE ID supports Google, Facebook, Github, Linkedin, Twitter, Twitch, and practically any other OAuth-enabled login provider.

With ORE ID, users of your app get an on-chain account upon first sign-in. Their private key is encrypted with a PIN of their choosing and stored for them so they don't have to remember their blockchain accounts or keys.

ORE ID also serves as a blockchain wallet for your your users. Your app can request a user to sign a transaction using their PIN to decrypt their keys.

ORE ID removes the friction between your app and your future users.
